Spotify Connect for Kodi
==========================

This project is a reimplementation of marcelvedt's plugin.audio.spotify addon for Kodi,
as that project seems to be abbandonned combined with many of the projects dependencies.

For that reason I decided to reimplemented the plugin using a minimal amount of dependencies.
The current state of the project is fairly barebones, and a lot of the integration with Kodi is missing.

## What Works

* Spotify Connect can start if LibreSpot is installed
* Spotify Connect automatically stops when Kodi shuts down

## What doesn't work

* Media controls
* Media metdata display in the Kodi GUI
* Volume controls
* ...
